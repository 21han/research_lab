If you want more grant, contact the administrator

## Step 1: setting access key and secret key
Contact adminstrator to get your secret_key and access key in .cred file

```sh
export S3_ACCESS_KEY='******'
export S3_SECRET_KEY='*****'
```

then source your .cred file
```sh
source .cred
```

verify your access key and secret key is in your env
```sh
printenv
```

Side note: to use the aws interface, we need to use boto3 package. please pull the lastest dependency and update your conda environment
```sh
conda env update --file env.yml
```

## Step 2: access via console using password
Using the console, you can see what is in the bucket clearer, which can be helpful.

open and paste the link to your browser

https://358643568593.signin.aws.amazon.com/console

- the username is "**strategy-access**"
- ask the adminstrator for password.

Now you will see list of bucket, however, you only have access to **coms4156-strategies**
